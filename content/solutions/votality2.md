        subtitle: 'CoCo 33'
        content: >-
          CoCo 33 is a pricing and risk management framework for regulatory capital securities issued by banks following the Basel III  
          
          capital adequacy requirements. It can be extended to cover regulatory capital securities issued by insurance companies 
          according to the Solvency II regulations.    

          It relies on a powerful equity-to-credit regime switching reduced form model with stochastic bail-in intensities and stochastic credit to analyse AT1 CoCo bonds, perpetual non-cumulative preferred shares and Tier 2 bonds issued by banks. The regime switching model is jointly calibrated on the market quotes of all relevant securities related to the issuing bank such as credit default swaps, options and bonds, on top of the regulatory instruments themselves. Joint calibration allows for consistent pricing and leads to meaningful hedge ratios and risk parameters.    

          Once the model for the underlying issuing company is specified, either through calibration or manually, it can be used to evaluate the regulatory securities, to produce hedge ratios or risk parameters, or to analyse various risk scenarios. The product includes a database of terms and conditions and a technology to  serialize and store either the model parameters or the entire environment used in the calibration.    

          CoCo 33 libraries are designed to integrate smoothly into existing risk management or front office systems. Excel add-ins offer an intuitive way to deploy the solution on a desk. A simple and intuitive Excel based utility is provided to test the various functionalities of the product.
