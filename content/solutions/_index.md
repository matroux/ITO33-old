          CoCo 33 is a pricing and risk management framework for regulatory capital securities issued by banks following the Basel III
           capital adequacy requirements. It relies on a powerful equity-to-credit regime switching reduced form model with stochastic bail-in intensities and                    stochastic credit to analyse AT1 CoCo bonds, perpetual non-cumulative preferred shares and Tier 2 bonds issued by banks.
