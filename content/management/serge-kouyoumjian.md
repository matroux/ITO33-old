Serge graduated from ESSEC, the French business school, in 1986, before leading a 
long and successful banking career in Paris, London and New-York as a fixed-income 
specialist, for names like CCF, UBS and Credit Suisse. He gained significant experience 
in market-making, trading, and risk-management. Serge is a co-founder of ITO 33, and
the one in charge of our business and commercial endeavors. He delights in the 
possibility that ITO 33 may grow to captivate the financial services community as a 
company with a grand vision and lofty aspirations, while being grounded in its research,
engineering and hands-on spirit. His happier moments include when he feels he has 
earned a new client's trust and support.

Products such as Opscore, which are live on the most sophisticated convertible bond 
desks, Serge likes to call our "produits finis". Everyone knows what they do better than 
any other software package, everyone knows what they cost. As for our "produits infinis" 
(and by that Serge means our ongoing scientific research), they are literally priceless.
